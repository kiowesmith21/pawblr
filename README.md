An animal blog made using React.JS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose

 In order to run this you will need to install the required dependencies like node.js, typescript, etc. Then run "npm run dev" while cd'ed into the backend folder. Then run "npm start" while cd'ed into the frontend folder. 

 This uses my own MongoDB data base and so you will need to create your own if you want to run the backend for this.
